Characters in C++ (and in many other programming languages) are stored as numbers according to the ASCII standard. 
In ASCII, the characters '0' to '9' are sequentially ordered and their numeric values are 48 to 57, respectively. 
The following code outputs 59. Modify one line of the code so it outputs 11 using the above hint. Explain your answer.

\begin{AnswerArea}

\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int sum = 5;
    sum += '6';
    cout << sum << endl;
}
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{3in}
\end{AnswerArea}




\begin{Solution}
\begin{verbatim}
sum += '6' - '0';
\end{verbatim}
This change converts the character '6' to its numeric value 6 (because '6' - '0' = 54 - 48 = 6).  
Adding this to the original value of `sum` (which is 5), the final output becomes 11.
\end{Solution}
